                "The main goal is to continue to build upon the community that weve created and differently from previous years [...] but I think a lot of it is just sort of smoothing the transition between sort of being an online club to going back into person, and just really reinforcing that community environment."

                    <p class="card_blurb">MVHS Dance Team performs in competitions, rallies and football games, hosting auditions at the end of each school year. This year it plans to relearn technique and condition itself and change its dancers' attitudes to focus on self-development. 
                        "We all had this idea of, 'Oh, we just want to be a family.' Whether that is in Dance Team or outside Dance Team, [despite] our individual goals ... whenever someone is in trouble, it is, 'Hey, I know who to call because they aren't just my teammate from dance, but they're my family."
